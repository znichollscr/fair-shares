    "empty_dataframe": """
Empty DataFrame provided for {dataset_name}.

WHAT HAPPENED:
  The DataFrame contains no data (zero rows).

LIKELY CAUSE:
  - Data source file is empty or missing
  - Filtering removed all rows
  - Data preprocessing failed silently

HOW TO FIX:
  Check your data source:
  >>> print(f"Rows: {{len(df)}}, Columns: {{len(df.columns)}}")
  >>> print(df.head())

  For data pipeline issues, review preprocessing notebooks to ensure
  data is being loaded and filtered correctly.
""",
    "index_structure_mismatch": """
Data structure error in {dataset_name}.

WHAT HAPPENED:
  The data has the wrong index structure.
  Expected: {expected} (country code and unit columns as index)
  Got: {actual} (current structure)

LIKELY CAUSE:
  The CSV was loaded without setting the index columns.

HOW TO FIX:
  After loading your data, set the index:
  >>> df = df.set_index({expected})
""",
    "year_columns_missing": """
Year columns not detected in {dataset_name}.

WHAT HAPPENED:
  No columns recognized as year columns.
  Year columns must be strings like '2020', not integers like 2020.
  Found columns: {found_columns}

LIKELY CAUSE:
  Your DataFrame has integer year columns (e.g., 2020, 2030)
  but fair-shares requires string year columns ('2020', '2030').

HOW TO FIX:
  Convert year columns to strings:
  >>> from fair_shares.library.utils import ensure_string_year_columns
  >>> df = ensure_string_year_columns(df)
""",
    "weights_exceed_limit": """
Invalid allocation weights.

WHAT HAPPENED:
  pre_allocation_responsibility_weight ({resp}) + capability_weight ({cap}) = {total}
  The sum must be <= 1.0

WHY:
  Only the ratio between weights matters — they are normalized by their sum.
  (0.3, 0.3) and (0.5, 0.5) produce identical results.
  When one weight is 0, the other is the sole adjustment regardless of its value.
  See docs/science/allocations.md#weight-normalization for how weights work.

VALID EXAMPLES:
  - pre_allocation_responsibility_weight=0.5, capability_weight=0.5 (equal weight to both)
  - pre_allocation_responsibility_weight=0.7, capability_weight=0.3 (pre-allocation responsibility-heavy)
  - pre_allocation_responsibility_weight=1.0, capability_weight=0.0 (pre-allocation responsibility only)
""",
    "missing_required_data": """
Missing required data for {adjustment_type} adjustment.

WHAT HAPPENED:
  You set {weight_name}={weight_value} but didn't provide {data_name}.

WHY:
  {explanation}
  See docs/science/allocations.md for data requirements.

HOW TO FIX:
  Either:
  1. Provide the required data:
     >>> result = {function_name}(
     ...     {data_param}=your_data_df,  # Add this
     ...     ...
     ... )
  2. Or set {weight_name}=0.0 to exclude this principle from the allocation

Target '{target}' not recognized.

WHAT HAPPENED:
  The specified target source is not valid.

LIKELY CAUSE:
  Possible typo in the target name.

HOW TO FIX:
  {suggestion}

  Valid target options:
  - 'rcbs': Remaining Carbon Budget Shares (temperature-aligned budget)
  - 'rcb-pathways': RCB-based pathways over time
  - 'ar6': IPCC AR6 scenario pathways
  - 'cr': Climate Resource scenarios

  See docs/science/allocations.md for target options.

Emission category '{category}' not recognized.

WHAT HAPPENED:
  The specified emission category is not valid for this data source.

LIKELY CAUSE:
  Possible typo or category not available in the selected emissions dataset.

HOW TO FIX:
  {suggestion}

  Common emission categories:
  - 'co2-ffi': CO2 from fossil fuels and industry
  - 'all-ghg-ex-co2-lulucf': All GHGs excluding CO2 from land use
  - 'all-ghg': All greenhouse gases including land use
""",

Required years not found in {dataset_name}.

WHAT HAPPENED:
  The dataset doesn't contain all required years.
  Required: {required_years}
  Available: {available_years}
  Missing: {missing_years}

LIKELY CAUSE:
  The data source doesn't cover the full time period needed for this allocation.

  For pre-allocation responsibility approaches, start date choice affects
  allocations. See docs/science/allocations.md#historical-responsibility.

HOW TO FIX:
  1. Use a different data source that covers {required_years}
  2. Or adjust your allocation parameters to be within {available_years}
""",
    "negative_values": """
Negative or zero values found in {dataset_name}.

WHAT HAPPENED:
  {value_type} must be positive values.
  Found {count} countries/years with values <= 0.

LIKELY CAUSE:
  Data quality issue or incorrect filtering.

  Note: Negative values may represent carbon sinks (land use change).
  Such entities require special handling in fair share calculations.

HOW TO FIX:
  Check your data for:
  - Missing values (NaN) that should be filtered
  - Countries with zero population (should be excluded)
  - Incorrect unit conversions
  - Carbon sinks that need separate treatment

  Example check:
  >>> print(df[df <= 0])
""",
    "allocation_year_future": """
Allocation year {year} is beyond data coverage.

WHAT HAPPENED:
  You specified allocation_year={year}
  but the data only covers up to {max_year}.

LIKELY CAUSE:
  Typo in the year, or data source doesn't extend far enough.

HOW TO FIX:
  1. Use an allocation year between {min_year} and {max_year}
  2. Or use a different data source with longer coverage
""",
    "infeasible_convergence": """
Cannot achieve convergence targets with current parameters.

WHAT HAPPENED:
  The cumulative per-capita convergence allocation cannot find a feasible solution.

CONTEXT:
  Convergence approaches transition from current emissions toward per capita targets.
  See docs/science/allocations.md#convergence-mechanism-pathways-only for mechanism details.

LIKELY CAUSE:
  - max_convergence_speed={speed} may be insufficient given the gap between
    current shares and per-capita targets
  - Time horizon ({first_year} to {last_year}) may be too short for gradual
    convergence at the specified rate
  - Initial emissions distributions may be far from population-proportional

HOW TO FIX:
  1. Accept approximate solutions (some parties may not fully converge):
     >>> result = manager.run_allocation(..., strict=False)

  2. Or increase max_convergence_speed (default 0.9, max 1.0):
     >>> result = manager.run_allocation(..., max_convergence_speed=0.95)

  3. Or extend the time horizon (allow more years for gradual transition):
     >>> result = manager.run_allocation(..., first_allocation_year=2020)
""",
    "shares_not_sum_to_one": """
Allocation shares do not sum to 1.0.

WHAT HAPPENED:
  The calculated allocation shares sum to {actual_sum:.6f}, not 1.0.
  Difference: {difference:.6e}

CONTEXT:
  Allocation shares must sum to 1.0 to ensure complete distribution.
  See docs/science/allocations.md#weight-normalization for details.

LIKELY CAUSE:
  Numerical precision issue or implementation bug.

HOW TO FIX:
  This is likely a bug. Please report this with:
  - The allocation approach used
  - Parameter values
  - Data shapes and sample values

  As a workaround, you can normalize shares:
  >>> shares_normalized = shares / shares.sum()
