"""Constants and variable aggregation rules for IAMC historical back-fill.

The :data:`IAMC_HISTORICAL_RELEASES` registry is loaded lazily from the
packaged ``fair_shares/conf/data_sources/iamc_data_sources.yaml`` on first
access, not at import time — nothing here touches the filesystem while the
module is being imported. To drop in a new release, add an entry under
``iamc_historical`` in the YAML and set ``active_iamc_historical`` to its
tag. No Python changes required. The section is pipeline-agnostic, so CMIP7,
CMIP8, or any future IAMC release plugs in under the same key.
