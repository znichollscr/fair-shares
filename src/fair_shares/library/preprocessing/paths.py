"""Path resolution for intermediate emissions files.

When an NGHGI LULUCF source is active (e.g. Melo), notebook 107 writes
NGHGI-consistent emission categories to filenames suffixed with
``_nghgi``. The PRIMAP (or equivalent) raw per-primitive outputs from
notebook 101 keep their base filenames. Downstream consumers use the
resolver here to pick the right variant for a given category.

Only the categories whose content genuinely depends on the choice of
LULUCF source require an NGHGI variant in the downstream pipeline:

- ``co2-lulucf`` — Melo NGHGI replaces PRIMAP bookkeeping LULUCF
- ``co2`` — FFI + Melo NGHGI, not PRIMAP total
- ``all-ghg`` — NGHGI co2 plus non-co2

``non-co2`` and ``all-ghg-ex-co2-lulucf`` are LULUCF-independent
(non-CO2 Kyoto gases, or PRIMAP totals excluding LULUCF CO2), so the
base PRIMAP filenames are used for them even when an NGHGI source is
active. This keeps the pipeline's ``source_id`` scheme (which only
appends the LULUCF tag for LULUCF-dependent categories) aligned with
the notebook 107 execution condition (``_needs_lulucf``).

The ``co2-ffi`` category is LULUCF-independent and always uses the
PRIMAP filename.
