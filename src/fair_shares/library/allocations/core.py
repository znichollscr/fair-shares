    """
    Validate that allocation weights satisfy mathematical constraints.

    Many allocation approaches in fair shares literature combine multiple
    principles--equal per capita, pre-allocation responsibility, and capability--
    using explicit weights. The Greenhouse Development Rights (GDR) framework,
    for example, uses weighted combinations of responsibility and capability
    indices (note: GDR was designed for burden-sharing; fair-shares uses an
    interpretation of its capability metric for entitlement allocation). This
    function ensures that
    user-specified weights are valid for such weighted allocation approaches.

    The weight constraints are:

    - Both weights must be non-negative (principles cannot be applied negatively)
    - Sum of weights cannot exceed 1.0 (the remaining weight is implicitly
      assigned to the equal per capita baseline)

    When both weights are zero, the allocation reduces to pure equal per capita.
    When weights sum to 1.0, no weight remains for the equal per capita baseline.

    The literature emphasizes that weighting between equity principles involves
    normative choices that should be documented transparently, as different
    weightings can substantially affect resulting allocations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pre_allocation_responsibility_weight
        Weight for relative per-capita rescaling based on emissions in
        the window [pre_allocation_responsibility_year, allocation_year).
        Must be >= 0. Higher values give more rescaling power to
        cumulative per-capita emissions in that pre-allocation window.
    capability_weight
        Weight for economic capability adjustment (must be >= 0).
        Higher values give more weight to ability to pay (typically GDP-based)
        when adjusting allocations. Applies from the allocation year onwards
        (contrast with pre-allocation responsibility, which covers the window prior to it).

    Raises
    ------
    AllocationError
        If weights are negative or sum exceeds 1.0.

    """
    Calculate population-based shares implementing equal per capita allocation.

    This function computes each group's share of world population, implementing
    the equal per capita principle that is foundational to fair shares
    allocation. The equal per capita principle holds that each person globally
    has equal entitlement to atmospheric space, meaning allocation shares should
    be proportional to population.

    For theoretical foundations, see:
        docs/science/allocations.md#building-blocks

    Parameters
    ----------
    population
        Population timeseries data indexed by group (e.g., iso3c).
    year
        Specific year to calculate shares for. If None, calculates shares
        for all years in the population data. The year must correspond to
        a column label in the population data.
    group_level
        Index level name for grouping (default: "iso3c").
    unit_level
        Index level name for units (default: "unit").
    ur
        Unit registry for unit conversions (default: default registry).

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series or pd.DataFrame
        Population shares that sum to 1.0 across groups.

        - If year is specified: returns Series with shares for that year
        - If year is None: returns DataFrame with shares for all years

    Notes
    -----
    The calculation:

    1. Converts population to millions for consistency
    2. Drops the unit level from the index
    3. Calculates group totals and world totals
    4. Returns shares = group_total / world_total

    --------
    >>> from fair_shares.library.utils import create_example_data
    >>> data = create_example_data()
    >>> # Calculate shares for a specific year
