#
# The ESABCC report draws directly on the Pelz/Rogelj/Riahi (hereafter PRR2023)
# technical report for its equity methodology. PRR2023 is the primary
# methodological source; the ESABCC report presents the conclusions.
#
# All equation and indicator references in the Method Extraction section below
# are to PRR2023 (the canonical methodological source).
#
# **Approaches reproduced (all approaches quantified in PRR2023):**
# - Equal Per Capita (EPC) budget allocation from two starting years (1990, 2015)
# - Equal Cumulative Per Capita (ECPC) budget allocation from two starting years
# - Responsibility-adjusted allocations on both the EPC and ECPC bases, for
#   every historical-emissions window in PRR2023 Table 18 that our data supports,
#   in both total and per-capita form, with both penalty functions F(x)=1/x and
#   F(x)=1/sqrt(x)
# - Capability-adjusted allocations on both bases, using GDP per capita
#   snapshots (1990 and 2014), with both penalty functions
#
# **Extensions beyond PRR2023:** the same approaches are run for three
# emission categories — `co2-ffi` (the report's scope),
# `all-ghg-ex-co2-lulucf`, and `all-ghg` (NGHGI convention). § 5 then
# computes each country's fair-share budget left from 2024 onward, after
# subtracting observed emissions through 2023, and § 6 spreads those
# remaining budgets into annual pathways to 2100.
#
# **Keep in sync with the Python API:** §§ 5–6 are ported to
# `fair_shares.library.python_api.calculate_allocation_timeseries` so
# downstream consumers can run allocations without executing this notebook.
# If you change §§ 4–6 here, regenerate the reproduction fixtures
# (`uv run python tests/fixtures/save_python_api_fixture.py`) and check that
# `tests/integration/test_python_api_reproduces_notebook.py` still passes —
# that test is the guard against the two implementations drifting apart.

# ## 0. Decisions taken in this reproduction.
#
# 1. **Two of the report's indicators are not reproduced** because fair-shares
#    has no data source for them: consumption-based CO2 (1990-2014) and capital
#    stock per capita.
# 2. **The Responsibility-Capability-Need composite is not quantified.** The
#    report itself declines to quantify it ("given the large solution space when
#    weighting the composite allocation approaches"); we follow the report.
# 3. **Three emission categories are run:**
#    `co2-ffi` (fossil and industry CO2 — the report's own scope),
#    `all-ghg-ex-co2-lulucf` (all greenhouse gases except CO2 from land use),
#    and `all-ghg` (all greenhouse gases, with land-use CO2 counted the way
#    national greenhouse gas inventories count it — the "NGHGI convention").
#    Note the library's name for "all-ghg-ex-lulucf" is `all-ghg-ex-co2-lulucf`:
#    only the CO2 part of land use is excluded; non-CO2 land emissions (e.g.
#    methane from agriculture) remain included.
# 4. **Multi-gas budgets are split in two.** A remaining carbon budget caps CO2
#    only, so for the two all-GHG categories the library allocates the CO2 part
#    as a budget and the non-CO2 part as an annual pathway taken from AR6
#    scenarios of the same climate target. Their outputs appear as separate
#    rows (`co2` or `co2-ffi`, and `non-co2`) and are also combined in § 5.
# 5. **The all-GHG categories start in 2015 only.** The report's second
#    allocation year (1990) is not possible for them: national-inventory
#    land-use data begins in 2000, and the non-CO2 scenario pathways do not
#    extend back before 2015. For `all-ghg` the historical-responsibility
#    window also starts in 2000 (data start) instead of 1850 or 1990.
# 6. For every country and approach: remaining = allocated total minus actual
#    emissions from the allocation year through the last year with observed
#    data (2023 in PRIMAP-hist v2.6.1 / Melo NGHGI), so budgets are reported
#    as remaining from 2024.
# 7. **One budget across the whole notebook.** The RCB registry holds three
#    sources at three climate targets; this notebook filters the pipeline to
#    the report's anchor only — IPCC AR6 500 GtCO2 from 2020 for 1.5C at 50%
#    (`source="ar6_2020"`, `climate-assessment="1.5C"`, `quantile=0.5`) — and
#    the matching 1.5C-50% scenario pathways for the non-CO2 part. To use a
#    different anchor, change `RCB_ANCHOR` in § 3 and re-run.
# 8. **Non-CO2 configs are derived from the CO2 configs.** The library
#     derives the non-CO2 pathway configurations automatically from the
#     budget configurations, so both gas components run the same equity
#     parameters, including the single-year GDP snapshot
#     (`capability_reference_year`). One parameter has no pathway analogue:
#     the 2050 cumulative-population cutoff (`cumulative_end_year`) bounds
#     the budget's population window and is removed on derivation, so the
#     non-CO2 population window runs to 2100.
# 9. **Time distribution of remaining budgets (§ 6).** Each country's net
#     remaining budget (which can be negative) is spread into an annual pathway
#     to 2100 with `distribute_remaining_budgets_pathways`: a
#     per-capita-convergence baseline plus a deviation envelope solved so every
#     country's pathway integrates exactly to its remaining budget. Two
#     envelope shapes are run — `half-sine` (debtor countries dip net-negative
#     and recover to the baseline by the deviation end year) and `exponential`
#     (debtors stay net-negative through 2100) — crossed with deviation end
#     years {2050, 2075, 2100}. An earlier deviation end year front-loads debt
#     redress; 2100 back-loads it. The baseline converges to equal per capita
#     by 2050. These are normative knobs — edit `DISTRIBUTION_GRID` in § 3.
# 10. **Net-sink countries at the start year.** In the `all-ghg` CO2 part
#     (NGHGI convention), 29 countries are net CO2 sinks in 2023. The
#     distribution function requires positive base-year emissions (they define
#     starting shares only), so these are floored at 0.001 Mt. Budgets are
#     unaffected. Per-capita target shares use the population projection in
#     the convergence year (2050). Only the CO2 parts are distributed; for the
#     all-GHG categories the combined annual pathway = distributed CO2 + the
#     AR6 non-CO2 pathway (Decision 4).
# 11. **Past non-CO2 over-use: two settlement options, both computed.** The
#     hist-2023 gap between actual and allocated non-CO2 is reported per
#     country in a `historical-deviation` column, and § 6 runs every
#     configuration under two modes, selected by the `nonco2-debt-mode`
#     column:
#     - **`free-rider`** — no penalty. Past non-CO2 over- and under-use
#       nearly cancel globally (§ 6.2 quantifies this at +0.6% of 2015-2023
#       non-CO2), so the historical debts are simply named and left at that.
#     - **`co2-debit`** — each country's non-CO2 over-use is subtracted from
#       its remaining CO2 budget (AR6 GWP100 equivalence): missing a methane
#       target costs CO2 space. The collected debt is retired. It leaves the
#       allocation entirely, so the sum of country CO2 budgets falls below
#       the global remaining CO2 budget by the gross debt sum (quantified in
#       § 6.2); the retired space benefits the climate, and the global
#       envelope pathway is rebuilt to the reduced total so country pathways
#       stay mutually consistent. CO2 budgets can go negative so debts of any
#       size are payable; methane pathways stop at zero, which is why large
#       debts are settled here in CO2 space rather than inside non-CO2 space.
#     In both modes past under-use earns nothing. The `co2-debit` results
#     depend on the GWP100 metric — equating old methane excess with future
#     CO2 space is an accounting convention, and a different metric would
#     give different numbers.
# 12. **Non-CO2 forward pathways stay as allocated.** Under both modes the
#     non-CO2 parts are the scenario-based allocations, unchanged; all
#     settlement happens in CO2 space, where negative pathways are
#     meaningful.

# ## 1. Method Extraction
#
# PRR2023 defines a systematic equity evaluation framework building from
# European Climate Law and international environmental law (Rajamani et al.,
# 2021). The report considers five allocation approaches: Equal Per Capita,
# Equal Cumulative Per Capita, Responsibility, Capability, and
# Responsibility-Capability-Need. Only the first four are quantified;
# the fifth is excluded due to the large weighting solution space.
#
# ### 1.1 Equal Per Capita (EPC) Budget
#
# The global equal per capita remaining carbon budget is (PRR2023, Eq. 1):
#
# $$
# \text{RCB}_{\text{EPC}} = \frac{\text{RCB}_{1990,2015}}{\sum_{r} P_{\text{PC},r}}
# $$
#
# where $P_{\text{PC},r}$ is the population of region $r$ in the starting year
# of allocation (1990 or 2015). Regional budgets are then (PRR2023, Eq. 2):
#
# $$
# \text{RCB}_{r} = \text{RCB}_{\text{EPC}} \times P_{\text{PC},r}
# $$
#
# **fair-shares equivalent:** `equal-per-capita-budget` with
# `preserve_allocation_year_shares=True` (single-year population shares).
#
# ### 1.2 Equal Cumulative Per Capita (ECPC) Budget
#
# Same as EPC but using cumulative population from the starting year to 2050
# (PRR2023, Eq. 1-2 with $P_{\text{CPC},r}$ = cumulative population):
#
# $$
# \text{RCB}_{\text{ECPC}} = \frac{\text{RCB}_{1990,2015}}{\sum_{r} P_{\text{CPC},r}}
# $$
#
# **fair-shares equivalent:** `equal-per-capita-budget` with
# `preserve_allocation_year_shares=False` (cumulative population shares, the default)
# and `cumulative_end_year=2050` to match PRR2023's explicit 2050 upper bound.
#
# ### 1.3 Responsibility-Adjusted Budget
#
# The responsibility-adjusted allocation modifies the EPC/ECPC base by a
# penalty function applied to cumulative historical CO2-FFI emissions
# (PRR2023, Eq. 3):
#
# $$
# \text{RCB}_{\text{adj},r} = \frac{F(x_{i,r}) \times \text{RCB}_{1990,2015}}
# {\sum_{r} F(x_{i,r}) \times P_{\text{PC/CPC},r}}
# $$
#
# where $x_{i,r}$ is the regional indicator value. Two penalty functions
# are applied (PRR2023, Section "Penalty functions"):
#
# - **F(x) = 1/x** — the second most severe of four functions PRR2023 tested;
#   penalizes high emitters strongly
# - **F(x) = 1/sqrt(x)** — less severe than 1/x, more lenient on high emitters
#
# PRR2023 also tested F(x)=1/x^2 (too harsh) and F(x)=asin(x)^(-1) (too
# lenient), but uses only 1/x and 1/sqrt(x) in final results. We do the same.
#
# **Responsibility indicators in PRR2023 Table 18, and their status here:**
#
# | Indicator | Allocation year | Reproduced? |
# |---|---|---|
# | Cumulative CO2-FFI 1850-1989 (total and per capita) | 1990 | yes |
# | Cumulative CO2-FFI 1850-2014 (total and per capita) | 2015 | yes |
# | Cumulative CO2-FFI 1990-2014 (total and per capita) | 2015 | yes |
# | Consumption CO2 1990-2014 (total and per capita) | 2015 | no — no consumption-emissions source |
#
# **fair-shares equivalent:** `per-capita-adjusted-budget` with
# `pre_allocation_responsibility_weight=1.0`,
# `pre_allocation_responsibility_functional_form="power"`, and
# `pre_allocation_responsibility_exponent=1.0` (for 1/x) or `0.5` (for
# 1/sqrt(x)). The window start is `pre_allocation_responsibility_year`; the
# total-vs-per-capita choice is `pre_allocation_responsibility_per_capita`.
# The report applies the adjustment to both the EPC and ECPC bases ("per
# capita or cumulative per capita"); both are run here via
# `preserve_allocation_year_shares` True/False.
#
# ### 1.4 Capability-Adjusted Budget
#
# Same structure as responsibility but using a single-year snapshot of GDP per
# capita or capital stock per capita as the indicator (PRR2023, Table 18):
#
# | Indicator | Allocation year | Reproduced? |
# |---|---|---|
# | GDP per capita 1990 | 1990 | yes |
# | GDP per capita 2014 | 2015 | yes |
# | Capital stock per capita 1990 / 2014 | 1990 / 2015 | no — no capital-stock source |
#
# **fair-shares equivalent:** `per-capita-adjusted-budget` with
# `capability_weight=1.0`, `capability_functional_form="power"`,
# `capability_exponent=1.0` or `0.5`, and `capability_reference_year` set to
# the snapshot year. Run on both the EPC and ECPC bases.
#
# ### 1.5 Responsibility-Capability-Need (Not Quantified)
#
# PRR2023 explicitly states: "We do not provide calculations using this
# allocation approach given the large solution space when weighting the
# composite allocation approaches." We follow the report and do not quantify
# it. fair-shares supports it via `pre_allocation_responsibility_weight` +
# `capability_weight` summing to <= 1.0 if a downstream user wants it.
#
# ### 1.6 Scope and Data Choices
#
# - **Emission category (report):** CO2-FFI only (excluding LULUCF and non-CO2).
#   This notebook additionally runs `all-ghg-ex-co2-lulucf` and `all-ghg`
#   (NGHGI convention) — see Decisions 3-5.
# - **Global RCB (report):** 500 GtCO2 from 2020 for 1.5C at 50% likelihood
#   (IPCC AR6 WG1); the report derives ~1530 GtCO2 from 1990 and ~704 GtCO2
#   from 2015 by adding back historical emissions. fair-shares performs the
#   same rebasing internally from its own historical series.
# - **Bunkers excluded** from historical emission attribution (both).
# - **LULUCF CO2 excluded** from the report's history and scope; here it enters
#   only the `all-ghg` category, in NGHGI convention (Melo et al. data).

# ## 2. Mapping to fair-shares
#
# | Paper approach | fair-shares function | Key parameters | Notes |
# |---|---|---|---|
# | EPC budget (single-year pop) | `equal-per-capita-budget` | `allocation_year=1990\|2015`, `preserve_allocation_year_shares=True` | PRR2023 allocates at R11 region level; fair-shares at country level. For linear operations the two are algebraically identical when summed back to the same grouping. |
# | ECPC budget (cumul. pop) | `equal-per-capita-budget` | `allocation_year=1990\|2015`, `preserve_allocation_year_shares=False`, `cumulative_end_year=2050` | `cumulative_end_year=2050` matches PRR2023's explicit 2050 upper bound. |
# | Responsibility 1/x, 1/sqrt(x) | `per-capita-adjusted-budget` | `pre_allocation_responsibility_weight=1.0`, `pre_allocation_responsibility_year=1850\|1990`, `..._functional_form="power"`, `..._exponent=1.0\|0.5`, `..._per_capita=True\|False`, both bases | Penalty F(x)=1/x maps to `power` with exponent 1.0; F(x)=1/sqrt(x) to exponent 0.5. Windows: 1850-1989 (ay=1990), 1850-2014 and 1990-2014 (ay=2015). |
# | Capability 1/x, 1/sqrt(x) | `per-capita-adjusted-budget` | `capability_weight=1.0`, `capability_functional_form="power"`, `capability_exponent=1.0\|0.5`, `capability_reference_year=1990\|2014`, both bases | GDP-per-capita snapshot; capital stock not available. |
# | R-C-N combined | `per-capita-adjusted-budget` | weights summing to <= 1.0 | Not quantified — follows PRR2023's own exclusion. |
# | (extension) non-CO2 part of all-GHG categories | `equal-per-capita`, `per-capita-adjusted` (pathway) | auto-derived from the budget configs | `capability_reference_year` passes through (pathway approaches support the snapshot); `cumulative_end_year` is budget-only and removed on derivation (Decision 8). |

# ## 5. Remaining budgets after the last observed emissions year
#
# Netting uses observed data only, through the last observed year (Decision 6
# — currently 2023, so remaining from 2024). The two kinds of part carry
# different semantics (Decision 11):
#
# - **CO2 budget parts** — remaining = allocated total minus **actual**
#   emissions from the allocation year through the last observed year. CO2 is
#   a stock budget: past over-use is a real debt (remaining goes negative)
#   and § 6 redresses it in the forward pathways.
# - **Non-CO2 pathway part** — remaining = the **forward-window allocation**
#   (2024-2100). The `historical-deviation` column reports actual minus
#   allocated non-CO2 over 2015-2023: positive means the country emitted
#   more non-CO2 than its allocation, a debt that § 6 can charge against its
#   CO2 budget (`co2-debit` mode, Decision 11); negative means under-use,
#   which earns nothing (space in short-lived gases cannot be banked).
#   Combined rows inherit the non-CO2 deviation unchanged.
#
# Outputs per category: `remaining_budgets_from_<year>.csv` in the category's
# allocation folder, plus a combined tidy CSV across all three categories at
# `output/601_remaining_budgets_from_<year>.csv`. Every row carries
# `netting-end-year` and `remaining-from-year` columns stating the accounting
# window explicitly. For the all-GHG categories the CSV contains the two parts
# and a `combined` row per matching configuration (CO2 budget remaining +
# non-CO2 pathway remaining).

# ## 6. Distributing remaining budgets over time to 2100
#
# Each country's net remaining budget from § 5 (negative allowed) is spread
# into an annual emissions pathway using
# `distribute_remaining_budgets_pathways` (Decision 9): a
# per-capita-convergence baseline plus a shared deviation envelope whose
# per-country amplitude is solved in closed form, so every pathway integrates
# exactly to its remaining budget. The normative grid crosses the two envelope
# shapes with three deviation end years:
#
# - **`half-sine`** — debtor countries dip net-negative mid-horizon and
#   recover to their per-capita baseline by the deviation end year.
# - **`exponential`** — debtors stay net-negative through 2100.
# - **Deviation end year** {2050, 2075, 2100} — earlier concentrates debt
#   redress early (front-loaded); 2100 spreads it to the horizon end
#   (back-loaded).
#
# **CO2 parts** are distributed under two non-CO2 debt modes (Decision 11):
# `free-rider` leaves the CO2 budgets as they are; `co2-debit` subtracts
# each country's 2015-2023 non-CO2 over-use from its remaining CO2 budget
# (AR6 GWP100) and retires the collected debt, shrinking the global envelope
# by the gross debt sum. Negative CO2 pathways are allowed (CO2 removal is
# real), so debts of any size are payable. **Non-CO2 parts** are the
# allocated scenario pathways, identical under both modes (Decision 12).
# `combined` rows sum the distributed CO2 part and the non-CO2 pathway per
# mode and shape variant; every row's `adjusted-target` column states the
# cumulative total its pathway integrates to.
# Outputs per category: `distributed_remaining_pathways.parquet` and `.csv`
# in the category's allocation folder.

# ### 6.2 Verification — do the pathways still add up to the remaining budgets?
#
# All emissions in this notebook are aggregated with **AR6 GWP100** (PRIMAP
# `KYOTOGHG (AR6GWP100)`; the unit registry applies the `AR6GWP100` context),
# so CO2 and non-CO2 quantities add on a consistent CO2e basis.
#
# For `all-ghg-ex-co2-lulucf`, one CO2-part creditor and one CO2-part debtor
# (the stock budget is where debt lives — Decision 6), across every
# shape/deviation variant and both non-CO2 debt modes:
#
# 1. **CO2-FFI part** — the cumulative distributed pathway (2024-2100) must
#    equal its `adjusted-target` exactly (closed-form guarantee of the
#    distribution function). Under `free-rider` that target is the § 5
#    remaining CO2 budget; under `co2-debit` it is that budget minus the
#    country's non-CO2 debt, which is retired (Decision 11). A debtor's
#    pathway integrates to its negative target either way.
# 2. **Non-CO2 part** — the allocated scenario pathway, unmodified in both
#    modes (Decision 12); its cumulative equals the § 5 forward allocation
#    and is non-negative by construction.
# 3. **Combined** — cumulative combined pathway = mode-adjusted CO2 target +
#    forward non-CO2 allocation (= the row's `adjusted-target`), exactly.
#    The difference between the two modes' combined totals for a country is
#    exactly its non-CO2 debt paid.

# ## 7. Implementation Notes
#
# This notebook implements PRR2023's allocation methodology using fair-shares'
# canonical data stack. The equations in § 1 are realised with the configurations
# in § 3; this section documents the implementation choices where fair-shares
# differs from PRR2023's own R code at the Zenodo archive
# (Pelz, Rogelj, Riahi 2023, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8035839,
# `iiasa/EUEquityReport_Replication` v1.1).
#
# ### 7.1 Data stack
#
# - **Population**: `un-owid-2025` — UN historical + WPP 2024 projections to 2100
# - **GDP**: `wdi-2025` — WDI `NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.KD` (constant 2017 international $ PPP)
# - **Emissions**: `primap-202503` — PRIMAP-hist v2.6.1 (Gütschow et al.),
#   territorial; observed country data through 2023
# - **NGHGI LULUCF**: `melo-2026` — Melo et al. LULUCF Data Hub v3.1.1,
#   2000-2023, used for the `all-ghg` category only
# - **RCB anchors**: `ar6_2020` (IPCC AR6 WG1, Canadell et al. 2021),
#   `lamboll_2023`, `forster_2024` — all computed; the report anchor is
#   `ar6_2020` at 1.5C / 50%
#
# ### 7.2 Key architectural choices
#
# **Country-level allocation.** fair-shares computes allocation shares at ISO3c
# level (~173 countries) and aggregates to larger groupings (EU27, R11 regions)
# post-hoc. PRR2023 aggregates country data to 11 R11 regions first, then computes
# shares at the regional level. For linear operations (EPC, ECPC) the two are
# algebraically identical when summed back to the same grouping. For non-linear
# operations (responsibility/capability-adjusted with `1/x` or `1/sqrt(x)`
# penalty), Jensen's inequality applies: country-level and R11-level allocations
# give different answers whenever within-region variance is material. See
# `docs/science/allocations.md`.
#
# **Capability snapshot.** PRR2023 uses a single-year GDP-per-capita snapshot
# (1990 for `ay=1990`, 2014 for `ay=2015`). The budget parts replicate this via
# `capability_reference_year`. The pathway (non-CO2) parts compute capability
# year-by-year — the snapshot kwarg does not exist for pathway approaches
# (Decision 8).
#
# **Approach coverage.** All four approaches PRR2023 quantifies are configured,
# on both the EPC and ECPC bases, for every Table 18 indicator with a data
# source: responsibility windows 1850-1989 (ay=1990), 1850-2014 and 1990-2014
# (ay=2015), in total and per-capita form; capability snapshots 1990 and 2014.
# Consumption CO2 and capital stock are omitted (no source; Decision 1). The
# responsibility-capability-need composite is not quantified (Decision 2).
#
# **Multi-gas decomposition.** For `all-ghg-ex-co2-lulucf` and `all-ghg`, RCBs
# constrain CO2 only, so the library allocates the CO2 component as a budget
# and the non-CO2 component as a pathway from AR6 scenarios of the matching
# climate category, in NGHGI convention where land use is involved. See
# `docs/science/other-operations.md` for the decomposition and the BM-to-NGHGI
# convention gap.
#
# ### 7.3 Where fair-shares and PRR2023 differ on inputs
#
# | Aspect | fair-shares | PRR2023 |
# |---|---|---|
# | GDP convention | constant 2017 PPP (`NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.KD`) | same |
# | Population historical | un-owid-2025 | OWID historical CSV |
# | Population projection | un-owid-2025 (UN WPP 2024) | IIASA WiC SSP2 v9_130115 (2013 vintage) |
# | Emissions | PRIMAP-hist v2.6.1 (CO2-FFI) | GCB 2022 |
# | RCB anchor | `ar6_2020` (+ Lamboll, Forster) | `ar6_2020` (Canadell et al. 2021) |
# | Allocation granularity | country (ISO3c) | R11 regions |
# | Capability indicator | GDP per capita (snapshot year kwarg) | GDP pc and capital stock pc |
# | Responsibility indicator | territorial CO2 (PRIMAP) | territorial (GCB) and consumption CO2 |
# | Penalty functions | `power`, exponents 1.0 / 0.5 | `1/x` and `1/sqrt(x)` |
#
# Downstream users comparing against PRR2023's published figures should
# aggregate fair-shares' country-level output to PRR2023's R11 regions before
# comparing — otherwise the country-vs-R11 Jensen gap will appear in the
# residuals. The R11 aggregation maps are in the PRR2023 archive at
# `Data/countrygrouping/isorgn.csv`.
